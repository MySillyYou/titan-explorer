# Titan Explorer
Titan Explorer is a RESTful API service built with Go that provides a set of endpoints for accessing and manipulating data in the application.

NOTE: This project is still in development.

## Getting Started
To install and run the API service, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gnasnik/titan-explorer.git`
2. Copy the `config.toml-example` file to `config.toml` and modify the configuration settings as needed.
3. Install dependencies: `go mod tidy`
4. Start the server: `go run main.go`

By default, the server runs on port 8080. You can change the port by setting the `ApiListen` variable.
